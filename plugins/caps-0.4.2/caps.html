	<p>
		<b>CAPS</b>, the C* Audio Plugin Suite, is a collection of
		refined LADSPA audio plugins capable of (and mainly
		intended for) realtime operation. The suite includes DSP units emulating 
		instrument amplifiers, stomp-box classics, 
		versatile 'virtual analogue' oscillators,
		fractal oscillation, reverb, equalization and more.
	</p>
	<p>
		My favourite user's quote: 
		<i>&ldquo;... if your amps beat your plugins, they
		are *very good* amps.. ;-)&rdquo;</i> &ndash; Thanks, Pete!
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of the suite is of my own invention, 
		while some plugins are rewrites of 
		existing designs, included for
		excellence or interest. 
		Inspiring code was authored by
		(in no particular order): 
		Andrew Simper, Perry Cook, Gary Scavone, 
		Steve Harris, Richard Dobson, Bram de Jong, 
		Robert Bristow-Johnson and others. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href=#ToneStack>ToneStack</a> plugins and the 
		tone controls of the <a href=#AmpVTS>AmpVTS</a> unit
		have been designed and implemented by 
		<a href=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dtyeh/>David Yeh</a> at 
		<a href=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/>CCRMA</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		All of CAPS is <a href=COPYING>free software</a> and distributed
		in source code. 
	</p>
	&nbsp;<br>

	<h5>* What's with the C?</h5>
	<p>
		So what does the <i>C</i> in the name stand for? Honestly, I don't know.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Complete?</i> Not yet. <br>
		<i>C</i> as in the programming language? The source is C++.<br>
		<i>Crap?</i> Heaven forbid!<br>
		<i>Cute?</i> Why not ...<br>
		<i>Common?</i> Not bad either. <br>
		<i>C,</i> the latin numeral for one-hundred? Some more to go, but I
		like the idea.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've got it! <i>C</i> as in <i>The <u>C</u>aps Audio Plugin Suite!</i> 
		A classic.

	<h5>No Guarantee</h5>
	<p>
		While I have bred all the plugins in the suite with the greatest care, 
		there is no guarantee
		that they will all retain perfect manners under all possible 
		circumstances. Take, for example, the <a href=#Lorenz>Lorenz</a>
		plugin, which models
		a fractal system. How am I to guarantee its 
		output will never go out of range, if people far more knowledgeable
		about this fractal than me assert its unpredictable behaviour?

	<a name=Installation><h3>Installation</h3></a>

	<p>
		Provided you run Linux, 
		installation is simply:
	</p>

	<pre align=left>
$ tar xvfz caps_0.4.1.tar.gz&nbsp;
$ cd caps-0.4.1&nbsp;
$ ./configure.py
$ make
$ su
# make install</pre>
	
	<p>
		(The <tt>configure.py</tt> step is optional but recommended.)
	</p>
	<p>
		You should now be able use the plugins from the collection
		in any LADSPA-aware host program, 
		like the wonderful <a href=http://pure-data.org>pd</a> with
		the <code>plugin~</code>
		<a href=http://pure-data.sourceforge.net/>external</a>,
		the inimitable <a href=http://jack-rack.sourceforge.net/>jack-rack</a>,
		the impressive <a href=http://ardour.org>ardour</a>,
		the versatile <a href=http://eca.cx>ecasound</a>,
		the classic <a href=http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/>snd</a>,
		and numerous other applications large and small.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You don't run Linux? Why not
		<a href=http://www.debian.org>downgrade now</a>?
	</p>
	
	<p>
		PPC and other non-x86 users may have to edit the 
		Makefile. 
		CAPS should compile on OSX but I haven't been able to test it.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Troubleshooting</h5>
	<p>
		With no external dependencies, compiling CAPS should rarely fail. If it
		does on your machine, please send the output of the <tt>make</tt> 
		command so we can try and fix the problem.
	</p>

	<h5>Bugs</h5>
	<p>
		If any of the plugins in the suite do not work with your host program
		of choice, or don't work as advertised, please 
		<a href=mailto:tim@quitte.de?subject=caps-bug>send a bug report</a>.
	</p>

	&nbsp;<br>

	<a name=WhatYouShouldKnow><h3>What You Should Know</h3></a>

	<h5>Parameter Smoothing</h5>
	<p>
		To prevent zipper noise, many plugin control inputs are subject 
		to internal parameter smoothing where the effort seems justified.  
		This is achieved by sweeping parameters internal to the plugin.  
		The duration of this sweep will vary with the audio system setup.
		For realtime use and most known LADSPA hosts it is equal to the audio
		block size (in <tt>jackd</tt> terms: the "frames per period").
	</p>

	<h5>Sample Rate</h5>
	<p>
		The CAPS plugins are designed to be used at
		sample rates of 44.1 kHz or higher.  Operation at lower sample rates 
		is generally possible but untested. 
		Especially the resonant filters in the 
		<a href=#SweepVFI>SweepVFI</a>, 
		<a href=#SweepVFII>SweepVFII</a>,
		<a href=#AutoWah>AutoWah</a> and 
		<a href=#Scape>Scape</a> plugins can self-oscillate out of 
		bounds at low sample rates and high filter cutoff frequency settings.
		It is a wise idea to do some silent test runs testing
		the entire parameter range to see if
		the plugin works as expected before relying on its operation at
		sample rates below 44.1 kHz.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the plugin listing, for every unit you'll see a note like 
		<em>All sample rates</em>. This means that the plugin should sound the
		same no matter what sample rate it is run at. If it doesn't, holler at
		me. 
		A note like <em>44.1 kHz only</em> means you
		can still run the plugin at other sample rates without having to fear
		for your life, but the sonic experience may differ from what is 
		advertised.
	</p>

	<h5>Realtime Use</h5>
	<p>
		All of the plugins in the suite are hard-realtime capable. In some
		cases, parameter smoothing will take a marginal number of
		extra CPU cycles when a control value is changed, as well as when the
		plugin is starting or resuming operation.
	</p>

	<h5>In-Place and Mixing/Replacing Operation</h5>
	<p>
		All of the plugins in the suite support any combination of in-place, 
		mixing and replacing operation.
	</p>

	<h5>Denormals</h5>
	<p>
		Denormal numbers 
		(<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal>wikipedia</a>)
		are the bane of DSP on common computer systems because they seriously
		slow down computing speed.  In CAPS, various approaches are employed to
		prevent this problem from arising.  Most of the plugins add an inaudible
		signal (-266 dB) at the Nyquist 
		(<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency>wikipedia</a>) 
		or at a fixed lower frequency which keeps calculations out of the critical
		zone around zero.  In addition, if you run <tt>configure.py</tt> prior
		to building CAPS, SSE extensions will be employed to aid in this task if
		they are available on the build system.
	</p>

	<h5>I'd love to hear from you. Really!</h5>
	<p>
		You like something about CAPS? Don't like it? 
		Either way, tell me &ndash; otherwise
		I'll never be able to improve it!
	</p>
	
	<h5>Known Bugs and Limitations</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>
			CPU usage figures, if given, may be inaccurate or even off by an
			order of magnitude.
		</li>
		<li>
			8x oversampling consumes a lot of CPU power.
		</li>
		<li>
			Since version 0.4.0, CAPS cannot be compiled with gcc 2.95 any more.
		</li>
		<li>
			Processing blocks larger than 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 aren't supported.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Start your guitar signal chain with an 
		<a href=#AmpVTS>AmpVTS</a>, followed by a 
		<a href=#CabinetII>CabinetII</a> and finish with a
		<a href=#Plate>Plate</a> reverb.  
		Season to taste, done.
	</p><p>
		Additional effects like 
		<a href=#ChorusII>chorus</a>, 
		<a href=#PhaserII>phaser</a> or
		<a href=#AutoWah>auto wah</a> would drop in right before or right after 
		the Cabinet (I usually prefer the latter).

	<a name=ThePlugins><h3>The Plugins</h3></a>

	<a name=Generic><h3>Generic</h3></a>

	<a name=Eq><h4>Eq</h4></a>
	<p>
		A ten-band, octave-spread equalizer. Based on a traditional analogue 
		design and about as faithful as digital IIR filtering allows. 
		Individual band filters are <nobr>6 dB / octave</nobr>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>All sample rates (bands beyond Nyquist are disabled).</em>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>31 Hz, 63 Hz, 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, 16 kHz</b></li>
			control the gain in dB for the respective band.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<a name=Eq2x2><h4>Eq2x2</h4></a>
	<p>
		By popular demand, a stereo-in, stereo-out version of the 
		<a href=#Eq>Eq unit</a>. 
		Same controls as Eq.
	</p>

	<a name=Compress><h4>Compress</h4></a>

	<p>
		A mono compressor, based on the SC1 design by 
		<a href=http://plugin.org.uk>Steve Harris</a> (in other words, a ripoff)
		with minor tweaks. Be
		careful with the gain and ratio controls, the output signal can easily
		exceed 0 dB.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>All sample rates.</em>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>gain (dB)</b><p>
			controls the maximum gain applied by the unit.</p></li>
		<li><b>ratio (1:n)</b><p>
			controls the overall gain.</p></li>
		<li><b>attack (s)</b><p>
			controls the speed at which the circuit acts on a rising input signal
			envelope.</p></li>
		<li><b>release (s)</b><p>
			controls the speed at which the circuit acts on a decaying input signal
			envelope.</p></li>
		<li><b>threshold (dB)</b><p>
			sets the envelope level that the compressor starts acting at.</p></li>
		<li><b>knee radius (dB)</b><p>
			controls the softness of the transition between unaltered and 
			compressed signal.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<a name=Pan><h4>Pan</h4></a>
	<p>
		Places a monaural source in the stereo field. For some extra spicing,
		the unit can also add a low-pass filtered echo at the far
		ends of the stereo field to make the signal sound 'wider' (recreating 
		the old doubling effect with a twist). You can 
		(and should!) control the loudness and timing of the echo; what's best
		depends largely on the source signal.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>No parameter smoothing.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>All sample rates.</em>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>pan</b><p>
			position</p></li>
		<li><b>width</b><p>
			echo volume</p></li>
		<li><b>t</b><p>
			delay in milliseconds<p></li>
		<li><b>mono</b><p>
			if non-zero, causes the unit to mix the stereo output back down to mono
			and output that (on both outbound ports). 
			The purpose is to check for mono
			compatibility of the output.<p></li>
	</ul>

	<a name=Emulation><h3>Emulation</h3></a>

	<a name=PreampIII><h4>PreampIII</h4></a>
	<p>
		One further step in the evolution of my 
		<a href=http://quitte.de/dsp/preamp.html>tube preamplifier emulation</a>. This one
		uses conventional polyphase FIR filters for 8x oversampling,
		which helps make the unit sound a good deal cleaner than the 
		IIR-based predecessor. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The first steps towards this unit were based on a <tt>spice</tt> model
		of the preamplifier circuit in a Fender 5F4 design ('Super' tube amp,
		a close relative of the famed 'Bassman', which is the ancestor of the
		Marshall lineage). Further evolution was 
		based on measurements of my 'Super 60' (mid-1980s) amp and, of course, 
		personal preference. 
		The plugin offers a softer kind of preamp clipping
		than the actual circuit, though it can be made to clip as harsh as the 
		original thing if given enough gain.
	</p>
	<p>
		A word of caution: at high 'temperature' settings, an input
		signal peaking above 0 dB can drive
		the first 'tube' stage into hard clipping. Since this stage of the
		circuit is run at the nominal sample rate, aliasing and thus sound
		quality degradation will occur.
		Do not overdrive the input, instead use the 'gain' knob for 
		harsh distortion, it offers more than enough of it. This applies to all
		Preamp and Amp units.
	</p>
	<p><em>All sample rates.</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>gain</b><p>
				controls the level of saturation. For a balanced (0 dB max.) 
				input signal,
				hard clipping will not occur below a gain value of 1.
			</p></li>
		<li><b>temperature</b><p>
				emulates the level of the input signal, thus how much the first 
				preamplifier tube will colour the signal. 
				The effect is very subtle.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<a name=PreampIV><h4>PreampIV</h4></a>
	<p>
		A variation on <a href=#PreampIII>PreampIII</a> with added tone controls
		before the clipping stage. The tone controls have the same
		flaws as their analog counterparts (phase cancellation at high band
		gains). But exactly because they are not linear-phase, they are quite
		useful in altering the distortion characteristics of the circuit.
	</p>
	<p><em>All sample rates.</em></p>
	<p>
		Same parameters as <a href=#PreampIII>PreampIII</a>, plus the following 
		(all in dB units):
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>bass</b><p>
				80 Hz band</p></li>
		<li><b>mid</b><p>
				300 Hz band</p></li>
		<li><b>treble</b><p>
				1200 Hz band</p></li>
		<li><b>hi</b><p>
				4800 Hz band</p></li>
	</ul>

	<a name=ToneStack><h4>ToneStack</h4></a>
	<p>
		A close model of the tone stack of a traditional instrument
		amplifier (of Fender origin), designed and implemented by David Yeh,
		discussed in [<a name=yeh06-1 href=#yeh06>2</a>]
		(see <a href=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dtyeh/tonestack/>his project page at CCRMA</a>).
	</p><p>
		This is the 'procedural' implementation which uses a direct form II filter,
		adapts to the actual sample rate and offers the choice of model
		from a selection of several classic tone stacks. 
		(The AC-30 is a crude approximation for which David isn't to blame. I
		simply dropped in the parameters although the circuit doesn't 
		match the one David modeled.)
	</p>
	<p><em>All sample rates.</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>model</b><p>
			0 - '59 Bassman<br>
			1 - '69 Twin Reverb<br>
			2 - '64 Princeton<br>
			3 - '59/'81 JCM 800<br>
			4 - '78 Club &amp; Country<br>
			5 - '59/'86 AC-30 of sorts

	<p>
		This circuit is loosely based on the <a href=#AmpIII>AmpIII</a> design. 
		The preamplifier stage has been augmented and tuned 
		to provide a warmer frequency response as well as slightly different
		clipping characteristics. But more significantly, AmpV emulates the 
		shortcomings of an unregulated power supply and their effect on the 
		total gain of the circuit, the operating point of the tubes and the
		clipping response.
	</p><p>
		AmpV's forte is a mellow sound at the transition from clean to rough, 
		at lowish 'gain' settings and moderate 'watts'.

		Unlike conventional impulse response emulators who rely on brute-force

		A resonant filter whose cutoff frequency is swept by a

		or theremin-like sounds (low h, lower frequency).

	<p>
		Please note that the most useful settings for the 'h' parameter

		HRTF with custom-shaped IIR filters. 
		Tell me how it works for you (you should
		have pretty good headphones to get the full effect). 
	</p>
	<p>
		The HRTF impulse response data has been collected and prepared 
		by MIT's Media Lab.
	</p>
	<p>
		This unit only utilizes the 0-elevation set (sound source is level
		with the listener).

	<a name=Changelog><h4>Changelog</h4></a>

	<pre>
0.4.2
  * fixed the 'model' port index for AmpVTS in the RDF generator

0.4.1
  * cleaned up Eq.h and Eq.cc (many g++ versions choke on the unused code
    there)
  * changed -O3 to -O2 in the g++ invocation

0.4.0
  * ToneStack plugins, by David Yeh
  * AmpV + Tone stack plugin, employing David Yeh's fine work
  * comment cosmetics
  * Amp* denormal protection fixed (or is it, Dave? ;)
  * minor code cleanup in Amp.cc
  * caps.rdf updated with plugin categories (thanks to Paul Winkler)
  * caps.rdf Cabinet* RDF preset labels renamed
  * AutoWah plugin
  * DSP::RMS reworked, may affect Compress plugin
  * DSP::Eq reworked for double precision and denormal protection
  * ./configure.py checks SSE availability
  * in case of SSE math denormal flush to zero activated for all plugins
  * all plugins renamed C* .. instead of CAPS: ..
  * Eq modified to play nice with ardour 
  * Eq2x2
  * introduced the Plugin base class, collecting common traits (normal etc)
  * getport() -- read access to control ports which is clamped to port bounds
    and maps inf and nan to 0 as well
  * all LADSPA_HINT_SAMPLE_RATE ports changed to *_LOGARITHMIC because
    of broken implementations (no surprise given the vagueness of ladspa.h
    regarding this matter) -- this means changed default parameters of the 
    affected ports, too
  * VCO* "latency" output ports removed
  * actual activate() call is deferred to first run() after activate() 
    in order to prevent inadvertent parameter smoothing sweeps during the first 
    block  of audio after activation, this should fix all problems with ardour
    (except those caused by denormals or invalid audio input)
  * caps.rdf installed by 'make install'
  * fixed a bug in tools/make-ps.py that caused the spectrum plots to 
    be inaccurate for multi-channel plugins

  * Chorus, StereoChorus relabeled, appended 'I' suffix
  * new PhaserII plugin (great stuff if I may say so)
  * Phaser relabeled, appended 'I' suffix
  * new AmpV plugin, based on AmpIII, emulates compression and distortion
    modulation through power supply shortcomings, plus lots of fine-tuning
    and an additional biquad. We're getting there!
  * all Preamp and Amp models fitted with a new 12AX7 model, linear
    interpolation of a sample table obtained from spice simulation

0.2.4
  * feedback default reverted to 0 for the Chorus units
  * fixed Cabinet to switch to correct gain at 'model' control change
  * fixed 'model' control in Cabinet to work with a broader range of hosts

  * CabinetII plugin: Cabinet with 32nd order IIR filters, more fidelity
    to the original frequency responses, supplied coefficients for 4 of the
    most used sample rates
  * applied the gcc-4 enabling patch
  * SweepVF renamed to SweepVFI
  * new SweepVFII plugin, variant of SweepVFI with Q modulated by a 
    second Lorenz fractal
  * dsp/exp2 dumped in favour of libm's exp2(3)
